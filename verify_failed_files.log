Category: entertainment, Article Path: ./News Articles/entertainment/353.txt, Verified Text: One puppet show that I personally would love to see made into a live action movie is Joe 90I have fond memories of Bod (not least of which because I look like him) and would like to see someone attempt to make it into a filmWould have loved to see Dungeons & Dragons made, but unfortunately the film that it was made into didn't come up to scratchIt's all very well and good remaking these classic TV shows and films with all the latest technology for a 'new' audience, but for me a lot of the original charm is lost when they do this, and seems more like a money making exercise to cash in on the original success of the programme than reinventing or improving itIt maybe that to an audience who have never seen the originals they can watch them without prejudice, but to people who have grown up with all these shows such as Thunderbirds and Magic Roundabout which are part of our childhood, they are never going to live up to expectationPart of the reason for the success of such classics as the Magic Roundabout was that the characters were not the sweet and cuddly creatures that you would expectI believe that Childrens classics should be left well alone, and I will not be surprised if the Magic Roundabout does not do well at the Box Office, especially since it will be going up against The Spongebob Squarepants movie, popular among children because it's original, witty, and modernThe thunderbirds film was apalling, not a patch on the puppet series I grew up with and the Magic Roundabout will never be the same without the voice of Eric ThompsonWell if it was a comedy then it would have to be someone like Steve MartinPersonally i'd like to see cartoons such as Transformers, Thundercats and MASKIt would be worth the price of admission alone to see the large screen version of Joe's carThe only one that isn't to be remade as yet is Thundercats, which I'd like to seeThe Magic Roundabout will never appeal to the children of today as it did all those many years agoI'm only 27 and don't remember the series from when it was on TV, but have the set on DVD and it's a classicOr even Jamie and the Magic Torchhmmmmm, I could go on and onThats the appeal though, it's so innocent (like Chorlton himself) and it would be a real shame if they did remake itSeems that the film and TV is doing the same now - it's just cheaper to take ideas from the past and rework them, rather than being daring and trying something newJust looking at the pictures of the animations for the new film show that these characteristics have not been preservedI'd like to see Mr Benn, with Brad Pitt in the title roleThis re-gurgitation of old films and TV shows makes me angry - it is corporate laziness resting on the safety of other people's ideas, because it guarantees to bring in the $$$Films of this sort have an unfortunate habit of Disneyfying everthing, and they just lose the real magic that made the show special in the first placePerhaps if the remakes were done in a 'Look Around You' mock-authentic style I might be interested   I recently re-watched some episodes and realised that there was a level of humour shown in Danger Mouse that was completely lost on me when I was a childHow about classics like Chorlton and the Wheelies, Rentaghost, Terrahawks, Bodoh the list could go on and on!!!Again, like so many of these nostalgia programmes, the animation - this time computer created flat-cell like animation - failed to match the original's cut out paper technique for inventiveness, and was woefully inadequateIt was only that Thunderbirds The Movie was targetted as a children't movie that really let it downI'd luv to see Willow the Wisp on the big screen but sadly without the late Kenneth Williams doing the voices it wouldnt be the sameTV shows such as Battlestar Galactica have new remakes, DJ's are sampling or re-working 70's and 80's musicI'd hate to see Bagpuss with perfect animation - I love that 'done in a shed' clunkiness and you couldn't recreate the magicAll I can say is bring back Danger Mouse, probably the greatest kids' show everLove to see Transformers with real actors and CGIJust imagine what could be achieved by using CGI in a remake of Fingerbobs the already disturbing hand antics of the bearded hippy, Yoffi could take on a whole new level with a more life-like Fingermouse  Bob the Builder, Postman Pat and Fireman Sam together in an epic adventure of fire, post and bricksThere WAS a new Captain Pugwash cartoon made a couple of years backI think remakes are a good ideaThe Magic Roundabout is out in the UK on 11 FebruaryOr perhaps Robbie Williams could get his much mooted acting career off the ground by taking on the role of Andy PandyIf they got a decent producer and writer the story line could be greatThe problem with bringing it to the big screen is that no-one could approach Oliver Postgate's wonderful voices  Noggin the Nog was one of the best children's programsBut of course for most of the episodes the lift would be out of order and they would have to use the stairs
